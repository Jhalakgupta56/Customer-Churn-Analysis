# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Customer churn analysis identifies why customers stop using a product or service and predicts who is likely to leave. This project uses data on customer behavior, demographics, and interactions to build predictive models, reveal churn patterns, and guide strategies to improve retention, reduce losses, and boost customer loyalty.
